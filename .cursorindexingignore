# WHAT IS THIS FILE?

# This file is used to limit indexing with .cursorindexingignore
# The .cursorindexingignore file uses pattern matching syntax identical to that used in .gitignore files.

# To implement Cursor’s ignore feature for indexing only, add a .cursorindexingignore file to the root of your codebase’s directory, and list the directories and files to be excluded from the index.

# Files listed in .cursorindexingignore will not be included in Cursor’s index but can still be accessed by Cursor’s AI-assisted features, including when Cursor searches the codebase and exposes it to LLMs.

# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Basic Examples:

# Ignore specific file `config.json`
# config.json

# Ignore `dist` directory and all files inside
# dist/

# Ignore all files with a `.log` extension
# *.log

# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Advanced Examples:

# Ignore entire codebase
# *

# Do not ignore `app` directory
# !app/

# Ignores logs directories in any directory
# **/logs

# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Considerations:
# - Blank lines are ignored
# - Lines starting with # are considered comments and ignored
# - Patterns are matched relative to the location of the .cursorindexingignore file
# - Patterns will override conflicting patterns listed earlier in the file

# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Ignore the following directories and files
