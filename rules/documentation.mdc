## Gitignore Standards
- Only add entries as needed for this specific project; do not pre-populate with generic/common ignores.
- Group related ignores (e.g., Node dependencies, build output, OS files, environment files, tool-specific files).
- Add clear, concise comments explaining the purpose of each entry or section.
- Regularly review `.gitignore` to ensure no unwanted files are committed.
- Add these to .gitignore:
    - archive/**
    - .cursor/**
