# Folder Structure
This applies to folder/project structure

- Use as few folders as necessary.
- Folder names should be descriptive but short.
- File names should describe the function of the file.
- File names and folders should be readable and easily understood.
- Keep it simple.
- Avoid overly complex hierarchies and file structures.
- Use snake_case naming convention.
- Use subfolders as needed, but sparingly.
- Avoid special characters and spaces.
- Create a README.md in the root folder.
- Create a changelog in the root folder and update it.
