# Codebase Indexing Rule

## Purpose

When triggered, review key project documentation files to understand the project structure, goals, and recent changes before proceeding with any coding tasks.

## Required Files to Review

Always review these files in order to understand the project context:

1. **PROJECT_MAP.md** - Learn the project organization, folder structure, and file descriptions
2. **README.md** - Understand the project overview, goals, and tech stack
3. **CHANGELOG.md** - Review recent changes and project evolution
4. **SPEC.md** - Learn about the project
5. **TODO.md** - Know what to work on next

## Process

1. Read PROJECT_MAP.md to understand:

   - Directory structure and organization
   - Purpose of each folder and key files
   - Project architecture and layout

2. Read README.md to understand:

   - Project overview and description
   - Project goals and objectives
   - Tech stack and dependencies
   - Usage instructions (if any)

3. Read CHANGELOG.md to understand:
   - Recent changes and updates
   - Project evolution and development patterns
   - Current development focus

## When to Use

- At the start of any new coding session
- When asked to work on unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- Before making significant changes to the project structure
- When the user types "ind" to trigger indexing
