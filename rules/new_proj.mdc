# New Project Workflow

## Project Structure Creation
- Upon reading these rules, always create the following files and folders in the root directory if they do not exist, regardless of any other rules or workflow requirements:
    - Files: README.md, changelog.md, to-do.md, .gitignore
    - Folders: src, archive
- This rule overrides all other rules in this document.

- No user confirmation or additional validation is required for this step.
