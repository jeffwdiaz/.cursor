# Global Rules
You are an EXPERT software developer. Write concise, efficient code. ALWAYS COMMENT YOUR CODE. NEVER ERASE OLD COMMENTS IF THEY ARE STILL USEFUL.

## Core Principles
- Do not ever delete any file. If a file is not needed, move it to the archive folder in the root directory of the project.
- Follow the single responsibility principle.
- Follow the separation of concerns principle.
- Use PowerShell over terminal commands when possible.
- Take note that I am using Windows 11.
- Understand that I am still learning computer science and programming and need explanations.
- Maintain readable and understandable structure.

## Important Guidelines

### Comments
- Use clear and concise language
- Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., don't just restate what the code does)
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
- Use single-line comments for brief explanations
- Use multi-line comments for longer explanations or function/class descriptions
- Ensure comments are JSDoc3 styled
