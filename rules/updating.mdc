# Document Updating Rules

Do not ask me if I want to proceed, just do it. Do not stop until these files are all updated.
Update the following files using the rules within this document:
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- PROJECT_MAP.md
- .gitignore

### README.md

Readme file should include:
- Project Overview
    - Overview of the project. Only update the project overview if necessary.
    - No more than 50 words
- Project Goal
    - Project goal. Only update the project goal if necessary.
    - No more than 50 words
- Tech Stack
    - Tech stack for the whole project. Fill in sections for Frontend, Backend, Database, and Other if they apply. Do not fill them in if they do not apply.

Use the following structure for the README:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Project Overview
Brief description

## Project Goal
Brief purpose

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: [List]
- Backend: [List]
- Database: [List] 
- Other: [List]
```

### CHANGELOG.md

Strict Formatting and Date Rules:
1. Always use the exact output from the date command as the entry header, including the correct year, month, day, and weekday. Do not use a hardcoded or example date.
   - Example: If today is June 27, 2025 (Friday), the header must be:
     `## 2025-06-27 - Friday`
2. There should only be one `# Changelog` header at the very top of the file. Do not repeat this header for each entry.
3. Each day's entry must include all four change types (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed) in this order, even if some are blank.
   - Example:
     ```
     ## 2025-06-27 - Friday
     ### Added 
     ### Changed
     ### Fixed
     ### Removed
     ```
4. Do not use dashes, bullets, or lists for the change types. Each type should be a single line, starting with the type and a colon.
5. Never use example dates in the actual changelog. Always use the current date.
6. New entries must always be added at the top, so the most recent day is first (reverse chronological order).
7. No extra blank lines between entries, except a single blank line between each day's entry.
8. If nothing was done for a change type on that day, leave the line blank (e.g., 'Added: ').

#### How to obtain the date:

Step 1: Run the date command
- Windows PowerShell (Primary): `(Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-dd - dddd")`
- Windows PowerShell (Alternative): `Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd - dddd"`
- Linux/macOS: `date '+%Y-%m-%d - %A'`

Step 2: Extract the date from terminal output
- Look for a line that matches the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD - DayName`
- Example: If you see `2025-06-15 - Sunday` in the output, use exactly that
- Ignore any command text, line breaks, or extra formatting around the date
- The date line should be the actual result, not the command itself

Step 3: Validate the extracted date
- Verify the format is exactly: `YYYY-MM-DD - DayName`
- Verify it's a real date (not an example from these instructions)
- If the date looks wrong or corrupted, re-run the command

Step 4: Use the exact extracted date
- Use the EXACT text from the terminal output
- Do NOT modify, assume, or substitute any part of the date
- Do NOT use hardcoded dates or dates from these instruction examples

Troubleshooting:
- If terminal output is messy: Re-run the command until you get clean output
- If command fails: Try the alternative PowerShell command
- If still having issues: Run the command multiple times and use the clearest result

#### Example of correct changelog format:

```
# Changelog

## 2025-06-27 - Friday
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
### Removed

## 2025-06-26 - Thursday
### Added
- New features
- Another new feature
### Changed
- Updates
### Fixed
- Bug Fixes
### Removed
- Removed file.txt
```

### .gitignore

- Only add entries as needed for this specific project; do not pre-populate with generic/common ignores.
- Group related ignores (e.g., Node dependencies, build output, OS files, environment files, tool-specific files).
- Add clear, concise comments explaining the purpose of each entry or section.
- Regularly review `.gitignore` to ensure no unwanted files are committed.
- Add the following to .gitignore and make sure they stay at the top:
- `**/.cursor/**`
- `**/archive/**`
- `**/.env`
- Only add files below the `# <--- AI Content Boundary` line

Use the following structure for the .gitignore file:
```
# All .cursor folders and all files within
**/.cursor/** 

# All archive folders and all files within
**/archive/**

# All environment variable files
**/.env
**/.env.*

# <--- AI Content Boundary
# <--- AI model has written all content below this line
```

### PROJECT_MAP.md

- Always begin by running `tree /F /A` at the project root to obtain the current directory and file structure.
- Use the output of `tree /F /A` to verify and update the directory tree section in PROJECT_MAP.md.
- Update PROJECT_MAP.md whenever you add, remove, rename, or move a folder or significant file in the project.
- Keep all folder and file descriptions accurate and up to date.
- Clearly note if a folder is a submodule, external dependency, or has a special role.
- Remove or update entries for deleted or archived folders/files.
- Maintain consistent Markdown formatting and style throughout the document.
- Ensure the directory tree and descriptions match the actual project structure.
- After major reorganizations or refactors, review the entire document for accuracy.
- Commit changes to PROJECT_MAP.md alongside the relevant structural changes in the codebase.
- Write descriptions with enough detail for new contributors to understand the structure.

Use the following structure for the PROJECT_MAP.md file:
```
# Project Map
