# Project Architecture and Structure Rules

## Files and Folders
- Keep the number of folders to a minimum.
- File and folder names should describe their function.
- Use snake case naming convention when possible.

### Example Folder Structure
project_root/
  backend/
  frontend/
  docs/
  archive/
  README.md
  CHANGELOG.md

  .gitignore
