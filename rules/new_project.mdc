# Project Architecture and Structure Rules

## New Project Workflow

- **This rule overrides all other rules in this document.**
- **No user confirmation or additional validation is required for this step.**
- Upon reading these rules, always create the following files and folders in the root directory if they do not exist, regardless of any other rules or workflow requirements:
    - Files: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, .gitignore, .env
    - Folders: archive, docs, frontend, backend
- The frontend folder must contain a src subfolder.
- Do not auto populate these files or folders.

### Example Template for new project

```
. (project root)
|   .gitignore
|   CHANGELOG.md
|   README.md
|
+---backend
+---frontend
|   +---src
+---docs

```
