# Documentation
Update the following files: README.md, changelog.md, to-do.md, .gitignore, using the rules below. Do not ask me if I want to proceed, just do it. Do not stop until these files are all updated.

## README File
- Readme file should include: Project Overview, Project Goal, Tech Stack.
- Project Overview
    - No more than 50 words
- Project Goal
    - No more than 50 words

## Changelog File
Do the following in order:
- Run `date` command to get the current system date.
- Use the exact date and time from the system's `date` command output, regardless of whether it seems correct.
- Put the most recent entry at the top of the document.
- Use `## YYYY-MM-DD - Weekday` for entry headers.
- The same type of changes should be grouped.
- The latest date comes first and should be towards the top of the file.
- Types of changes include: Added, Changed, Removed, Fixed.
- There should be a new entry each day work is done.

## Gitignore File
- Only add entries as needed for this specific project; do not pre-populate with generic/common ignores.
- Group related ignores (e.g., Node dependencies, build output, OS files, environment files, tool-specific files).
- Add clear, concise comments explaining the purpose of each entry or section.
- Regularly review `.gitignore` to ensure no unwanted files are committed.
- Add these to .gitignore:
```
# All .cursor folders and all files within
**/.cursor/** 

# All archive folders and all files within
**/archive/**

# All environment variables
**/.env
```
